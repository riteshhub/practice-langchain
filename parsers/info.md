## Structured Output
It is a method for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) return data in a consistent, predictable format—such as JSON or schema-based structures—instead of unstructured plain text.

## Output Parsers
Output parser is responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it to a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Useful when you are using LLMs to generate structured data, or to normalize output from chat models and LLMs.
